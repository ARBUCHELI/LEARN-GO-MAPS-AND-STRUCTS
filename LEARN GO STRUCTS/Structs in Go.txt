# STRUCTS IN GO
---------------

* Introduction
--------------
We often have many variables related to each other, but managing using them all together can be a headache. Luckily, Go provides us with a way to group several variables into one custom 
data type. These types make the code cleaner, more intuitive, and less error-prone.

In Go, grouping together related variables is done using a struct. Throughout this lesson we will explore:

	. What a struct is

	. How to define a struct

	. How to access and modify a struct’s fields

	. How to write functions that work with structs

	. How to nest structs inside each other

With structs, we can define custom types that allow us to handle any kind of related data. To use these structs, we need to define what is inside of it. In the next exercise, we will 
discuss how to define structs we can use in our programs.

introduction.go
---------------
package main

import "fmt"

type Pet struct {
	name    string
	petType string
	age     int
}

func main() {
	nuggets := Pet{"Nuggets", "dog", 4}
	mittens := Pet{"Mittens", "cat", 7}
	robin := Pet{"Robin", "bird", 2}
	fmt.Println(nuggets)
	fmt.Println(mittens)
	fmt.Println(robin)
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Defining a Struct
-------------------
We’ve just learned the importance of structs in grouping complex data types. But how do we define the structs we’ll use in our programs? In this exercise, we will introduce the syntax for 
defining structs.

The definition of a struct includes its name and its fields. A field is one of the internal variables inside a struct. We use the following template:

// Struct names begin with a capital letter in Go
type NameOfStruct struct {
  // Struct fields go here
}

Let’s say we want to define a 2D point with an x and y coordinate. We could define two variables x and y and use them throughout our program. However, using multiple related variables in 
this way is error-prone. We might use x when we mean y, and dealing with many points could cause confusion.

A better way to represent a 2D point is to create a struct called Point which contains both coordinates. Defining Point in this way logically groups together the relevant data types. We 
would define the struct for Point like so:

type Point struct {
  x int
  y int
}

Using this new type, we would be able to pass Point information around our program as a single variable!

Now that have our struct defined, we need to be able to use them. In the next exercise will learn to create instances of our defined structs. First, let’s practice defining them in our 
programs.

* Instructions
--------------
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
We are going to make a struct that holds country information!

Let’s get started by defining an empty struct called Country.

We will fill in the fields at later checkpoints.


Hint
Recall the template for defining a struct:

type Pet struct {
// Fields of Pet Go here
}

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
Inside the Country struct, define a field called name of type string.


Hint
We can define string fields like so:

type Random struct {
  name string
}

Checkpoint 3 Passed
3.
Now define a variable called capital of type string that will represent the name of the country’s capital.


Hint
Recall from earlier how we defined multiple fields inside of Point:

type Point struct {
  x int
  y int
}

Checkpoint 4 Passed
4.
Add two fields inside of Country, latitude and longitude, of type float32 that will represent a country’s position.


Hint
These variables are defined in the same way you would define an ordinary float32.

type SensorValue struct {
  temp float32
}

exercise2.go
------------
package main

import "fmt"

// Country struct goes here
type Country struct {
  name string
  capital string
  latitude float32
  longitude float32
}

func main() {
	var france Country
  fmt.Println(france)
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Creating an Instance of a Struct
----------------------------------
We’ve defined our structs, but how do we create variables of that type? To use a struct we just defined, we have to create an instance of it. Assume we defined Point from the last 
exercise. We could create an instance of it like so:

p1 := Point{x: 10, y: 12}

or

var p1 = Point{x: 10, y: 12}

Using this syntax, we can define values for each of the struct’s fields. However, Go allows us to rely on default values as well. We can omit fields:

p1 := Point{x: 10}
// y will be set to 0

In fact, we can omit all fields to rely only on default values:

p1 := Point{}
// x and y will be set to 0

The order of our struct definition allows us to avoid labeling our fields. The values are assigned from left to right according to how the fields are defined in the struct from top to 
bottom.

p1 := Point{10, 12}
// Same as var p1 = Point{10, 12}

When not using labels, we must provide values for every field; otherwise, our code will not compile.

We’ve learned how to create struct instances, but how do we use them? In the next exercise, we will discover how to access and modify a struct’s values in our programs. For now, let’s 
practice creating some instances!

* Instructions
--------------
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
A local school needs our help organizing its data.

Given the struct Student, create an instance called peter which represents the student named Peter Bookman who is 16 years old and is in grade 11.

Print peter when finished.


Hint
Recall that creating an instance of a struct is done like so:

p1 := Point{x: 10, y: 12}

or

p1 := Point{10,  12}

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
Create a second instance of Student called scott which represents the student Scott Peterson who is in 12th grade (notice Scott’s age is not defined).

Print scott when finished.


Hint
Since age is not defined, we have to instantiate the struct with syntax similar to:

p1 := Point{x: 10}

exercise3.go
------------
package main

import "fmt"

type Student struct {
	firstName string
	lastName  string
	age       int
	grade     int
}

func main() {
	// Define your instances here
  peter := Student{"Peter", "Bookman", 16, 11}
  fmt.Println(peter)

  scott := Student{firstName: "Scott", lastName: "Peterson", grade: 12}
  fmt.Println(scott)
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Accessing and Modifying Struct Variables
------------------------------------------
We’ve defined our struct and created an instance, it’s time to use them. In this exercise, we will explore how to access and modify a struct’s variables.

Let’s say we have an instance of the Student struct:

	john := Student{"John", "Smith", 14, 9}

We can access individual fields within struct using the name of the variable, a ., and the name of the field. We could access John’s first name like so:

	fmt.Println(john.firstName)

We can change the value of a field with an assignment statement:

	john.age = 15

John’s just turned 15!

Using field access and modification finally allows us to be able to use structs in calculations for our program.

Now let’s practice this concept!

* Instructions
--------------
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
Given the struct Restaurant, create an instance of it with the following initial values:

	. name: Codecademy Steakhouse
	. typeOfRestaurant: Japanese
	. yearEstablished: 2011

Call this instance restaurant.

Also, print out the restaurant instance.


Hint
Recall an instance of the Student struct is created and printed like so:

student1 := Student{"John", "Smith", 14, 9}
fmt.Println(student1)

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
Print the value of each field of restaurant on a separate line.


Hint
The fields for student1 were printed like so:

fmt.Println(student1.firstName)
fmt.Println(student1.lastName)
fmt.Println(student1.age)
fmt.Println(student1.grade)

restaurant should be printed in the same way.

Checkpoint 3 Passed
3.
Change the values of name to “Skillsoft Steakhouse” and yearEstablished to “2022”.


Hint
Recall that the age field for student1 was changed in the following way:

student1.age = 15

Checkpoint 4 Passed
4.
Print out the updated restaurant instance.


Hint
The student1 instance was printed like so:

fmt.Println(student1)

exercise4.go
------------
package main

import "fmt"

type Restaurant struct {
	name             string
	typeOfRestaurant string
	yearEstablished  int
}

func main() {

	// Add your code here.
  restaurant := Restaurant{"Codecademy Steakhouse", "Japanese", 2011}
  fmt.Println(restaurant)
  fmt.Println(restaurant.name)
  fmt.Println(restaurant.typeOfRestaurant)
  fmt.Println(restaurant.yearEstablished)
  restaurant.name = "Skillsoft Steakhouse"
  restaurant.yearEstablished = 2022
  fmt.Println(restaurant)
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Functions that Access a Struct
--------------------------------
We can use functions to capture logic involving our structs and simplify it.

Structs will often have important operations that can be performed on them. For example, with a struct representing a geometric shape, it would be natural to have functions that compute 
its area and perimeter.

Let’s say we have a struct describing a rectangle. The rectangle struct will contain two fields: the length and the width. We define this struct:

type Rectangle struct {
  length float32
  width  float32
}

We can define a function that computes the area of the rectangle; the product of the length and the width.

func (rectangle Rectangle) area() float32 {
  return rectangle.length * rectangle.width
}

The key thing to notice is the line (rectangle Rectangle). This line signals to Go that the area() function belongs to the Rectangle struct. Note that functions associated with a struct 
are written outside of the struct!

If we have an instance of Rectangle called rect, we can call the area() function like so:

	rect.area()

Defining a function in this way will only pass in a copy of the rectangle: that is, we will not be able to use the function to alter the value of a field!

If we want to write a function that allows us to modify the value of a struct field, we have to pass in a pointer to a struct. We will see how this works in the next exercise.

Before we modify our structs in functions, let’s practice writing basic struct functions!

* Instructions
--------------
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
Given the struct Triangle which represents a triangle by its base and height, write an associated function called area() that computes the area of a triangle. The area of a triangle is of type float32

The formula for the area of a triangle is:

	Area = 1/2 (base * height)

Hint
If we were to write a function for the Rectangle struct that computes the perimeter of a rectangle called perim, we would do it like so:

func (rect Rectangle) perim() float32 {
  return 2.0*rect.length + 2.0*rect.width
}

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
In main(), call the area() function and print the result.


Hint
If we were intialize a rectangle, call the function perim(), and print the value, we would do it like so:

rectangle := Rectangle{4.0, 2.0}
fmt.Println(rectangle.perim())

structs.go
----------
package main

import "fmt"

type Triangle struct {
	height float32
	base float32
}

// Checkpoint 1 code goes here
func (triangle Triangle) area() float32 {
  return (triangle.base * triangle.height)/2
}

func main() {

	triangle := Triangle{10, 4}
  fmt.Println(triangle)

	// Call the function here
  fmt.Println(triangle.area())
}
